every time time an action which considered useless the reward is -1. Uselles considered an action when the hp or the mp doesn't change.
Although this approach has impact at the other rewards. For example if a new area is discovered and the player hp remain the same the final reward is 4.
In the same manner when a health potion is used correctly (the player earns 20hp) the reward is 101.
move to new area reward 5
negative useless movement:
	move to already discovered area 
	move towards wall area 
	attack an enemy aimlessly 
	killed by an enemy
	attacked by an enemy
	use health potion aimlessly
	use mana potion aimlessly
pick weapon aimlessly
